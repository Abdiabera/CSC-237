## Project Overview

This repository contains the work completed for the CSC-237 course final project. The project was developed using C++ and demonstrates understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, problem-solving, and application of course material.

### Contents

- **C++ Final Project 
  This document outlines the requirements, specifications, and objectives for the final project. It details what is expected in terms of functionality, structure, and grading criteria.

- **main.cpp**  
  The main implementation file for the project. This file contains the core C++ code that fulfills the requirements described in the project PDF. The code demonstrates the use of classes, algorithms, and logic as specified by the assignment.

### What Was Done

- Carefully reviewed the project requirements in the provided PDF to ensure all objectives were addressed.
- Designed and implemented the solution in C++ using best practices for code clarity and organization.
- Applied object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism where appropriate.
- Tested the program thoroughly to verify correct behavior and fulfillment of all project requirements.
- Documented the code and included useful comments for future reference or extension.

### How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (such as g++, clang++, or MSVC).
2. Compile the program:
   ```
   g++ -o final_project main.cpp
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```
   ./final_project
   ```

### Additional Notes

- Refer to **C++ Final Project.pdf** for a detailed explanation of the assignment and grading rubric.
- The code is organized for readability and ease of understanding. Comments are included to guide you through the logic.
